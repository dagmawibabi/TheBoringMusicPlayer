Here I am waiting, I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come, we knew it all along
How did it come so fast?
This is our last night but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know, when I wake
I will have to slip away
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Here I am staring at your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright, the stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down
This is way too hard
'Cause I know, when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be memory
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
I never wanted to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight I need to hold you so close
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah)
Ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa (yeah), ooh whoa """,

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game
Some people think
That the physical things
Define what's within
And I've been there before
That life's a bore
So full of the superficial
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah
Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young
Some people need three dozen roses
And that's the only way to prove you love them
Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be
With no one to share, with no one who truly cares for me
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you
Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing

If I ain't got you with me, baby, oh, ooh
Said nothing in this whole wide world don't mean a thing

Tell me what you're crying for
I'll wipe your tears, oh love
If your soul is aching love
We'll comfort you for sure
If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where you are, I'll run to your front door
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times, you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up
Just to get to your heart
If we're caught in a wave
Baby, we'll make a way
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
Love, between our love
Love, between our love
Shadows play on idle hands
I lose myself, I do
But I've found my way to velvet sands
I'll crash right into you
If we're caught in a wave, I will carry you over
It don't matter where were we are
You're still the one I choose
When my head goes in different directions
You know my heart's never on the move
And in the dark times you don't have to question
If I'm a hundred with you
You could put an ocean between our love, love, love
It won't keep us apart
You could build a wall, I would run it up, up, up (run it up)

Still got the flowers that you sent
And the note you wrote that said that we were meant
To be forever
An' I keep them all as evidence
In a drawer under the mirror
Filled with empty promises
I don't know why
I keep letting you lie to me
Hard as I try
It seems I can't break away
I thought that you would be the hero
Come and save the day
But you're a villain
Your sins unforgiven
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Hoo-waa)
Go 'head and wish me well (Haaa)
I'll cry a wishing well (Haaa)
I'll fly before I fail (Haaa)
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears
I catch your scent in every wind
And I recall the love we had, I can't pretend
That I don't miss you every now and then
But the hurt is for the better
Moving on, it's now or never
(Hoo-waa)
Lost in the tide, I can't keep my pillows dry
Like there's a sea in my eyes
I realize that sometimes love brings you flowers
Then it builds you coffins
And far too often
We end up falling to our demise
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Hoo-waa)
Go 'head and wish me well (Haaa)
I'll cry a wishing well (Haaa)
I'll fly before I fail (Haaa)
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats
In a river of tears
In a river of tears (Woo-ooh-ooh)
Cry me a river, build myself a bridge
I'm over this
Can't let memories become the death of me
I'm glad to see everything that you are
And I believe that you are everything I needed
But I don't need no more
I'm going down, and you have watched me drown
In a river of tears, lost beneath the stream
Under the waves, I've found the strength to say
The river of tears has washed me clean
(Hoo-waa)
Go 'head and wish me well (Haaa)
I'll cry a wishing well (Haaa)
I'll fly before I fail (Haaa)
I'll set sail and drift away
So I won't need you here
Love sinks and hope floats

It is if everyone dies alone
Does that scare you?
I don't wanna be alone
I look for you
Every day, every night
I close my eyes
From the fear, from the light
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I long for you
Just a touch (does that scare you?)
Of your hand
You don't leave my mind
Lonely days, I'm feeling
Like a fool for dreaming
As I wander down the avenue, so confused
Guess I'll try and force a smile
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
I just want somebody to die for
I just want somebody to die for (to die for)
I just want somebody to die for
(Does that scare you?)
(I don't wanna be alone)
Pink lemonade sippin' on a Sunday
Couples holding hands on a runway (oh)
They're all posing in a picture frame
Whilst my world's crashing down
Solo shadow on a sidewalk
Just want somebody to die for
Sunshine livin' on a perfect day
While my world's crashing down
